\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
%<In this paragraph present the context of the thesis, introducing the subject of MAS, MABS and some of their uses. Refer that standards exist and why. Introduce the next subchapters too.>

\section{Problem}
%The following problems will be explained:
% - Full featured MAS development frameworks are often not the most appropriate to develop simulations.
% - Most popular simulation frameworks don't support any agent interaction standards
% - Porting code from one framework to the other is typically not a feasible solution 

\section{Motivation}
% It is useful that MAS be tested in a controlled simulation environment using proper simulation tools that may not be available in their destination platform;
% Simulations typically have a higher performance than complex MAS frameworks, so there is an opportunity to gain performance when executing tests and simulations;
% JADE and Repast are popular tools in widespread use and are well documented and supported by their communities so it is easier to build on top of them;
% "It is feasible to bridge the gap between MAS simulation and development by embedding FIPA-standards and JADE features in a simulation framework."
% "The development of a robust MAS can be partially automated from a previously tested simulation."

\section{Goals}
% To enable interaction standards in simulation frameworks;
% To develop an API that replicates the essential JADE features, while abdicating of JADE's networking   infrastructure and more complex internal features in order to gain in simulation performance;
% To develop an automatic code conversion tool (CCT) that uses this API to transform Repast-based simulations into JADE MAS;
% To add the possibility to convert some JADE MAS into simulations, based on the API and using the code conversion tool;
% To validate generated code by confirming that the execution of the simulation and the generated MAS produce identical behaviour;
% To make the API generic enough, allowing for future extension to support multiple simulation tools
