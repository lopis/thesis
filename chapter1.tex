\section{Context}

Multi-agent systems (MAS) are composed of autonomous computational elements capable of interacting with each other, called agents. \cite{wooldridge2008introduction} These systems use an interesting software paradigm with multiple applications such as problem solving, simulation and negotiation using an efficient and modular development approach. \cite{ferber1999multi}
Many times such systems are created from scratch, meaning that the developers must define all features of the system - such as its agents, their behavior, communication and organization, using conventional tools and
languages. However, several frameworks exist that offer some level of abstraction from the code, allowing for a more conceptual approach to
MAS development. \cite{gormer2011jrep} These frameworks generally provide the programmer with a range of features such as communication protocols, agent awareness capabilities and simulation facilities.

As a concrete example, and as the object of this thesis, JADE and Repast are
two popular MAS development frameworks that offer a different group of
features.

\begin{quote}
	``JADE simplifies the development of distributed applications composed of autonomous entities that need to communicate and collaborate in order to achieve the working of the entire system. A software framework that hides all complexity of the distributed architecture is made available to application developers, who can focus their software development just on the logic of the application rather than on middleware issues, such as discovering and contacting the entities of the system.'' \cite{bellifemine2003jade}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
	``[Repast] provides a library of objects for creating, running, displaying, and collecting data from an agent-based simulation. In addition, RePast includes several varieties of charts for visualizing data (e.g. histograms and sequence graphs) and can take snapshots of running simulations [...] and can properly be termed a “Swarm-like” simulation framework.''

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:goals}
The motivation for this thesis has to do with taking advantage of each
framework's best features in distinct phases of MAS development.

Each MAS needs different tools. Furthermore, in the course of its development
there may be a need to use a different set of features. For instance, while
developing a large scale MAS, a need for creating a simulation based on the
same model may arise. The reverse can occur as well; the development may start
as a simulation that later must be implemented with another kind of framework.

While JADE excels in creating seamless, distributed, peer-to-peer systems,
Repast's strength is in creating simulations as well as collecting and displaying statistical data in different ways.


\section{Goals}
The first goal of this thesis is to create a code conversion tool. This tool enables the programmer to generate a Repast simulation automatically from the source code of a JADE application, as well as deploying a proper multi agent system in JADE starting from a Repast simulation.
Such a conversion tool not only allows the developer to quickly deploy a MAS or create a simulation, as explained before, but also enables a proficient programmer in one framework to quickly get started in developing with the other framework.

The second goal is to bring communication standards to Repast. While JADE complies with the FIPA standards for agent interaction, Repast implements no standards at all. Creating a library for implementation of FIPA interaction
protocols in Repast will not only enrich that framework but will make the code
generation more direct.

One of the soft goals for the final product is that the programmer should not be forced to introduce significant changes to the original code in order to be able to use the tool. The generated code must also preserve the functionality of the original code - meaning that the re-conversion must generate code that is equivalent to the original one.
 

\section{Thesis contents} \label{sec:struct}

After this introduction, chapter \ref{chap:sota} starts by discussing some related work about JADE, Repast and about integrating both frameworks. Furthermore, a great part of this thesis is about Java code transformations, since the goal is to convert the code from one framework to the other.
Therefore, part of the state-of-the-art research was related to code
transformation tools.
