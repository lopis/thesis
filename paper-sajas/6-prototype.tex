\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:prototype}

In this section we specify some of the current developments that are making use of \apiname{}, namely a code conversion tool that enables developers proficient in one of the frameworks (Repast or JADE) to port their implementations to the other framework.

\subsection{Conversion Tool Prototype}

The goal of the tool we propose is to allow the automatic conversion of Repast simulations into JADE applications. This conversion tool will not only allow the developer to quickly generate a MAS or create a simulation but also enables a proficient programmer in one framework to quickly get started in developing with the other framework. Figure \ref{fig:prototypeFlow} illustrates these two plausible workflows.

The code conversion tool uses the Java Development Tools (JDT) from Eclipse which enables Java programmers to perform introspection and reflection tasks with ease. This approach allows programmers to perform code transformations without having to create parsers for Java code and abstract syntax trees (AST).

The conversion tool will be developed in the form of an Eclipse plug-in, in order to be able to make use of all JDT features.

\subsection{\apiname{} development}

Although \apiname{} is already fit for thed gitevelopment of Repast simulations, it is open to enhancements, namely by enriching it with further missing JADE features. One important trait of \apiname{} is that, although thought for Repast, it is very generic. This means that MABS built using other Java simulation tools can integrate our API successfully in the future and, therefore, use JADE-based features.
