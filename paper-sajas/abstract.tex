% 1 - Intro
Agent-based applications and simulations are in widespread use today in both research and industry.
\gls{MAS} and \gls{MABS} are two approaches to make use of multi-agent systems technology, each with distinct characteristics and goals.
% 2 - Problem
While open agent-based applications benefit from adopting interaction standards, most \gls{MABS} frameworks do not support them.
% 3 - Proposal 
In this paper we propose an architecture, based on FIPA and JADE, for agent-based simulations, focusing on supporting agent communication using FIPA interaction protocols.
Based on this architecture, we present the \apiname{} API, whose goal is to bring JADE and Repast, two popular \gls{MAS} and \gls{MABS} development frameworks, closer together, facilitating the creation of simulations by JADE programmers and enabling an automatic portability between both frameworks.
% 4 - Experimentation/Validation
For illustration, we show the creation of a simulation where agents interact in a contract net.
Finally, we present an early overview of a code conversion tool whose aim is to automatically generate a JADE \gls{MAS} from a Repast simulation that makes use of \apiname{}.
