\chapter*{Abstract}

Multi agent systems (MAS) use an interesting software paradigm offering an efficient and modular development approach. Multiple frameworks exist to help develop MAS, each with a different set of features and purposes. During the development of a full featured MAS, developers sometimes feel the need to create a simulation of the actual system.

JADE \cite{bellifemine2003jade} is a very popular agent development framework but its multi-threaded architecture, appropriate for distributed MAS, comes short in delivering the necessary performance to run a local simulation with a large number of agents \cite{mengistu2008scalability}. Repast \cite{collier2003repast} is an agent-based simulation toolkit that allows creating simulations using rich GUI elements and real time agent statistics. However, Repast lacks much of the infrastructure for agent creation and interaction that JADE provides.
In this thesis, a code generation tool is proposed, capable of not only generating a Repast simulation from an existing JADE MAS, but also of creating a full featured JADE application from a Repast-based simulation. An implementation of FIPA's interaction protocols is also proposed for Repast.
